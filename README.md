# arithmetic-string-parser
This repo contains the code for an arithmetic string parser.

This code defines a parseArithmeticExpression function that takes an arithmetic expression as input and returns its result. It first tokenizes the input expression, then uses the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert it into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), and finally evaluates the RPN expression to compute the result.
